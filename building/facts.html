        <h2 style="color:#6495ed;">World Skyscrapers Day happens on 3 September every year to celebrate the super-tall structures that have forever changed the skylines of cities around the world. Dating back to the 19th century, these towering buildings first began popping up in Chicago and New York.

Chicago’s ten-story Home Insurance Building, built in 1884, was the first building to win the title of skyscraper, prompting other cities and architects to start building up. Since then these soaring architectural works have multiplied, pushing boundaries of technology and engineering to reach ever greater heights.

Today, these giants are among the most popular city attractions and make regular appearances on social media for their dizzying views. Read on to discover 10 of the most famous skyscrapers in the world.
The Burj Khalifa, with its 2716ft height, is the tallest skyscraper in the world, which is why it deserves the first place in our ranking. Opened in 2010, it also holds some other impressive records, such as having the world’s tallest service elevator, the world’s tallest outdoor viewing platform and the world’s tallest mosque. Among the highlights of the Burj Khalifa are its viewing platforms: At the Top, on floors 124 and 125, and At the Top Sky, on the 148th floor, where you can admire the desert and the Arabian Gulf 1821ft above sea level. Between floors 152, 153 and 154 there’s also The Lounge bar where you can sip cocktails at exhilarating heights.

Fun fact: In the United Arab Emirates everything is bigger and the Burj Khalifa is no exception. It can be seen up to 59 miles away.
